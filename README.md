# Product RESTful API
RESTful API for managing a collection of sneaker products. The API allows users to perform various operations related to sneakers, including creating, reading, updating, and deleting product entries. It is designed to be a lightweight and efficient solution for handling sneaker product data.

# Branches
- The `express` branch is dedicated to the development of the front-end and back-end of our application using Node.js and the Express.js framework. Here, you'll find code related to the user interface, API routes, and other features built on the Node.js stack.
- The `golang` branch focuses on building and enhancing the server-side components of our application using the Go (Golang) programming language. This branch contains code for the API server, background jobs, and other Golang-specific features.

## Features
- **Product Management**: Easily manage sneaker products, including details like brand, model, colorways, and pricing.
- **Search and Filtering**: Implement powerful search and filtering functionality to find sneakers based on various attributes.
- **Pagination**: Handle large datasets gracefully with built-in pagination.

## Technologies Used
- **Node.js**: The API server is built using Node.js for its speed and scalability.
- **Express.js**: We utilize Express.js to create a robust and maintainable API.
- **Gin**: Provides a fast and minimalistic approach to building robust APIs.
- **Fiber**: Provides a routing engine and various middleware options for building efficient APIs.
- **MongoDB**: Stored in a MongoDB database, providing flexibility and performance.
